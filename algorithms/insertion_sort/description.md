# Insertion Sort

Implement insertion sort in your preferred language. Consider the following for our next meeting:

- Why does this algorithm have a worst case complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>)?
If you don't know what Big O Notation is, check out [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/) to learn about it.
- Do you think that this algorithm is useful? Why or why not?

You may submit a pull request for this repository, but please make sure your algorithm works first.
